1. Hello, I'm Erica from Leeds. I'm a freshman in college. I like sports and I go swimming after school. I go about once or twice a week. 
2. Hi, my name is Marti Cheen from York. Iâ€™m a salesman in a big department store. I like music and I often go to concerts at weekends. 
3. I'm Tim Russell from Edinburgh. I'm a college student. College is very expensive, so I have to do a part-time job in a restaurant at weekends. I plan to visit Europe this summer, so I have to save almost every penny for this trip as well. 
4. My name is Linda from London. I'm in high school at present, I have a part-time job in a fast-food restaurant. It's Hamburger Heaven. I want to go to a good university, so I have to save all my money for college. I work three hours on Saturdays and Sundays.

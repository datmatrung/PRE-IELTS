Henry VIII was born in Greenwich Palace in London in 1491. He married six times and had six wives. He died in 1547
Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII and she was born in 1533, the same place as Henry VIII. She was a very popular and strong queen. During her reign, England became very important in European politics, in commerce and the arts. She died in 1603. She never got married.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford in 1564. By 1603, the year when Queen Elizabeth I died, Shakespeare was already the leading poet and dramatist of his time. He continued to write for the next ten years, but in 1616, he finally stopped writing and went to live in Stratford where he died in the same year. Queen Victoria was born in London in 1819 and died in 1901. Sir Winston Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace in 1874 and died in 1965.

How do you spend your day? Tom
Well, right now, I’m in high school, but I also have a part-time job. So I’m pretty busy. I get up early, around 6:00 a.m. Then I work from seven until nine. I go to school at 9:30, and I study until 4:00 p.m. Then I work again from five until seven.
So what do you do?
I’m a dog walker
What? What’s that?
A dog walker. I take people’s dogs for walks. It’s great, and it keeps me in good shape, too.
Then, what do you do after seven?
I have supper at 7:30. I start to do my homework at 8:00. It often takes about an hour and a half to finish the work, then I watch TV for about two hours. I go to bed at 11:30.
Your day is hard, the same as mine is.

From 1975 to 1985, the percentage of households with one car decreased slightly  
from 46.4% in 1975 to 45.2 % in 1985. However, the percentage of households with two or more cars rose during this period. It is perhaps surprising that more households had a television than a washing-machine. In fact, the percentage of households with television was over 90% throughout the ten years. There was a steady rise in the percentage of homes with central heating from 30 % in 1975 to 60 % in 1985.
The percentage of households with telephone showed a steep increase from 51.9 % in 1975 to 80.5% in 1985. The number of UK households with home computers showed a large jump, from only 2.5 % in 1975 to 12.6 % in 1985. One of the most noticeable features of this report is the addition of figures for video recorders. 30% of British homes had video recorders in 1985. It seems likely that both video recorders and home computers will become more common in homes in the UK in the future.

Hello, this is Business Nationwide, Daniel’s speaking, how can I help you?
Hi there, er, I’ve recently started up a small business, and I noticed on your website that you run some courses for people who are starting up.
That’s right, we do. We offer two courses which may be of interest to you.  Our first course is called ‘Getting Started’.  It’s a two–hour evening course, and it runs from 6pm to 8pm. We discuss things like ‘Is starting a business right for me?’, writing a business plan and some of the legal issues. It runs at various locations in the area. Where are you based?
I live in Eastleigh.
Eastleigh.  So, the closest course to you would be in Handbridge, and the next one is on the 20th March.
Uh-huh, and how much is that.
That one is free.
Okay, well it might be worth it.
But did you say you’re trading already?
Yes, since about August.
Well, you might be better off taking our three-day course – ‘Business Basics’. It’s not free I’m afraid – it’s subsided and costs £80 for the three days, unless you’ve been unemployed in the past six months, in which case it’s just £20.
No, that doesn’t apply to me.
Well, it’s well worth the money. The three days cover the essential aspects of running a business.  The first day covers legal issues, such as tax, insurance, employment laws and health and safety. The second day covers marketing and pricing, and the third covers accounting and book-keeping.
It sounds useful.  Does the ‘Business Basics’ course take place in Handbridge too?
Er, let me see.  No, it’s not available in Handbridge, I’m afraid. The nearest course to you would be in Renton. There’s one on the 5th March, and another on the 18th April.
Yes, that might be useful.
I’ll send out a pack to you if you like, with some details of the courses and also some information about what you need to do to set up and who you need to register with.
Great.
Can I take your name?
Yes, it’s Lila Park.
Lila? Is that L-A-I-L-A?
NO, L-I-L-A.
Lila Park.  And your address please?
39 White Lane, Eastleigh.
And have you got an email address? If so, we can send you details of any courses that are happening near you that you might be interested in.
Yes, it’s lila dot park at rainbow dot com
Great, well I’ll have the information pack sent out to you today.
Thanks, that’d be great.
My pleasure. Bye.

Hello, 6438186
Hello, I’m ringing about the room you have advertised.
Oh, yes
Is it still available?
Yes, yes, it is
I wonder if you could tell me something about it.
Yes, Well, what would you like to know
Well, I was wondering …… er  … how much is the rent?
It’s forty pounds a week.
And what does that include?
The room, of course. It's a single room. So you don't have to share. But you do have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. 
Are any meals included? 
No, no meals. You have to cook for yourself. 
Right,... and what about heating? 
There is a coin meter in the room. You can turn the heating on any time just by putting some coins in. So the heating is exclusive of the rent. 
Oh, I see. Is the cooker gas or electric? 
Electric. As I said, you share the kitchen with the other tenants.
OK, and do you want the rent weekly or monthly? 
You have to pay weekly, on Monday. 
And do I have to pay a deposit? 
Yes, I'd like a deposit of one month's rent. 
Right. That sounds fair enough. Are there any particular rules that I have to keep? 
Well, guests should be out by eleven o'clock. We don't really like to say that, but well, we've had a lot of trouble, so we have to. 
Uhuh. Is it quite near public transport? 
Oh yes. Five minutes to the tube station, and the bus stop is just round the corner - the buses into town run every ten minutes or so. 
Lovely. It sounds great. When is the room available? 
It'll be available from the 2nd of April. 
That will be next week then, good. ... er. .. do you think I could come and have a look at it this evening?
Yes, of course. Do you have the address? 
No, I don't. Could you tell me where it is? 
All right. It's 34 Church Road, Highgate. How'll you be coming? 
By tube. 
Good. It is very close to Highgate tube station. It's near the post once, opposite the school. 
I see. I think I know it now. Can I come about six this evening? 
Well, I might not be back at six. So let's say eight. Is that OK? 
Fine. 
Oh, could you tell me your name? 
Gretta Faulkner. 
Sorry, the line is not good. Could you say it again? 
Gretta. 
Gretta, I'll see you around eight then. Goodbye. 
Bye-bye.

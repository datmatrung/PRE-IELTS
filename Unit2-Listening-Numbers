London has been called the most expensive city in the world,
though like all other cities, if you know your way around,
you can always find lower prices that people normally pay.
Transport is expensive compared with other places.
The minimum bus fare is 40p. This is only for about a kilometers' ride.
If you want to go further, you have to pay more.
The fares on the underground are the same. The minimum fare is 50p,
and if you want to go more than two or three stations, it costs more.
The minimum taxi fare is 2 pounds. If you want to go out of London;
you can take a coach. It is the easiest and most economical way to
travel around London by coach. A coach fare is about 1 pound 20.

A telephone call to another London costs 50 and posting a letter costs 40p. 
A loaf of bread is 40; a bottle of beer is 1 pound 50.
Very few international students will have their own washing machines

which is a place where washing machines are provided for the general public.
Here are some prices for the use of a washing machine.
It's 2 pounds 50 for using a large washing machine and 1 pound 80
for using a small one. You have to pay 1 pound 50 for using a tumble drier,

Bus fare (minimum) 40p - Underground fare (minimum) 50p
Taxi fare (minimum) £2 - Coach fare £1.20

London has been called the most expensive city in the world,
though like all other cities, if you know your way around,
you can always find lower prices that people normally pay.
Transport is expensive compared with other places.
The minimum bus fare is 40p. This is only for about a kilometers' ride.
If you want to go further, you have to pay more.
The fares on the underground are the same. The minimum fare is 50p,
and if you want to go more than two or three stations, it costs more.
The minimum taxi fare is 2 pounds. If you want to go out of London;
you can take a coach. It is the easiest and most economical way to
travel around London by coach. A coach fare is about 1 pound 20.

In London, accommodation is another very expensive thing.
You would pay about 40 pounds a week for one room.
If you want to rent a one-bedroom flat, it will cost more.
You would generally pay about 200 pounds per week for it. 
A telephone call to another London costs 50 and posting a letter costs 40p. 
A loaf of bread is 40; a bottle of beer is 1 pound 50.
Very few international students will have their own washing machines
so it is likely that you will have to do your washing at a launderette,
which is a place where washing machines are provided for the general public.
Here are some prices for the use of a washing machine.
It's 2 pounds 50 for using a large washing machine and 1 pound 80
for using a small one. You have to pay 1 pound 50 for using a tumble drier,
about 2 pounds 40 for a medium-sized packet of washing powder.

In the 1985, there were 6,261 full-time undergraduate students
with 3,472 men and 2,742 women at the university.
This distribution of these students was as follows.
1. Beginning with the field of science, we find high domination
of the field by men, with 1,137 men and 616 women enrolling in science.
2. Next, in the field of social science, we again find domination by men,
the figures being 484 for men, 401 for women.
3. In the number of engineering, the difference is even greater.
The number for men is 509 while only 56 women are enrolled in engineering.
4. In the field of arts, the number for is 593 and for women it is 943.
This is the first field we find dominated by women.
5. In medicine, there are 306 men and somewhat more women at 336.
This is a second field in which women lead.
6. Turning to dentistry, as you might expect, the field is dominated by men.
The number for men is 139 and for women it is 107.
7. In law and in veterinary science, we are happy to see
there isn’t much difference between men and women in these two field.
In law men number 182 and women 171. In veterinary science the figure
for men is 110 while for women it is 104.

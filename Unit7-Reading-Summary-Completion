Marcel Bich
The man who turned a luxury item into an everyday object Marcel Bich, a French manufacturer of traditional ink pens,
was the man who turned the ballpoint pen into an item that today almost anyone can afford. 
Bich was appalled at the poor quality of the ballpoint pens that were available, and was also shocked at their high cost. 
However, he recognised that the ballpoint was a firmly established invention, 
and he decided to design a cheap pen that worked well and would be commercially successful.
Bich went to the Bib brothers and asked them if he could use the design of their original invention in one of his own pens. 
In return, he offered to pay them every time he sold a pen. 
Then, for two years, Bich studied the detailed construction of every ballpoint pen that was being sold, often working with a microscope.
